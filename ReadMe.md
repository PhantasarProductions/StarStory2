![Yorno](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805395-8f541350-6239-4c90-a98a-79b68f6460f7.png) | *Berindo Yorno* is Klahré's assistant and gadgeteer in his free time. Yorno is a very intelligent man, yet very insecure and has a lot of trouble expressing himself properly.
![Salp'r'drita](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805393-4e31c0e9-667e-4d59-8831-aa93d539d8e4.png) | *Salp'r'drita* is a doctor who works in the medical staff of M.E.T.E.O.R. He has a very strong devotion for his job and a very gentile personality. 
![Ashley](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805394-9a3be218-b3b3-41b9-ba44-036ac1453ef1.png) | *Ashley Johnson* was appointed as Klahré's bodyguard. She has a very careless personality and a total disregard for rules and regulations. She can also be pretty foul-mouthed at times and doesn't appear to have any respect at all for any kind of authority. She also has the tendency to quote novels, movies and even Shakespearean plays whenever the opportunity to do so arises.




## Features
Quick mouse controlled interface.
Turn based combat based on the "card" system (also used in The Fairy Tale Revamped).
All characters have their unique abilities
A female protagonist (it appears to matter to some people)
An interesting science fiction story line
A New Game+ feature in which you can transfer all your items, levels obtained abilities and such, but in which the enemies will be significantly stronger. Are you up to this?
Bilingual. You can play the game in both English and Dutch, and translations to other languages are not that hard.
Three difficulty settings, so the game can be a nice start up for the newbie, but offer a challenge to the no-life gamer. It just depends on what kind of gamer you are.


## Platforms
Windows will be the primary target, however since the underlying Apollo engine was entirely coded in C++ and its source code has been released under the terms of the GPL3 ports to other platforms should be easily possible.

## Site

The game has its own page on [itch](https://phantasar-productions.itch.io/star-story-ii).


## Operation SCI

Like Dyrt, Star Story I and The Fairy Tale before, Star Story II is also scheduled to be translated to Scyndi for usage in Scyndi's Creative Interpreter. No ETAs have been set for the start and especially not the ending of that operation.
- When you see this repository on Codeberg... Fantastico... Nothing to fear, this repo will likely be the "base of operations" when the time comes.
- When you see this repository on Github... It will remain here and be updated, but that is until further notice. A few "red flags" that hint that Microsoft is going in a direction I don't like have appeared. 
- When you see this repository on BitBucket... This is likely a deprecated repository then. The website of BitBucket is malfunctioning on me, plus their token system that will be mandatory from June 9th, 2026, doesn't work at all (none of my tokens were ever accepted for some silly reason). Unless Bitbucket gets its stuff fixed, no updates from June 9th on are to be expected, meaning that when you see this message after that date, chance is big you're looking at an outdated page.
