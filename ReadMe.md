![Yorno](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805395-8f541350-6239-4c90-a98a-79b68f6460f7.png) | *Berindo Yorno* is Klahré's assistant and gadgeteer in his free time. Yorno is a very intelligent man, yet very insecure and has a lot of trouble expressing himself properly.
![Salp'r'drita](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805393-4e31c0e9-667e-4d59-8831-aa93d539d8e4.png) | *Salp'r'drita* is a doctor who works in the medical staff of M.E.T.E.O.R. He has a very strong devotion for his job and a very gentile personality. 
![Ashley](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11202073/134805394-9a3be218-b3b3-41b9-ba44-036ac1453ef1.png) | *Ashley Johnson* was appointed as Klahré's bodyguard. She has a very careless personality and a total disregard for rules and regulations. She can also be pretty foul-mouthed at times and doesn't appear to have any respect at all for any kind of authority. She also has the tendency to quote novels, movies and even Sharespearean plays whenever the opportunity to do so arises.




## Features
Quick mouse controlled interface.
Turn based combat based on the "card" system (also used in The Fairy Tale Revamped).
All characters have their unique abilities
A female protagonist (it appears to matter to some people)
An interesting science fiction story line
A New Game+ feature in which you can transfer all your items, levels obtained abilities and such, but in which the enemies will be significantly stronger. Are you up to this?
Bilingual. You can play the game in both English and Dutch, and translations to other languages are not that hard.
Three difficulty settings, so the game can be a nice start up for the newbie, but offer a challenge to the no-life gamer. It just depends on what kind of gamer you are.


## Platforms
Windows will be the primary target, however since the underlying Apollo engine was entirely coded in C++ and its source code has been released under the terms of the GPL3 ports to other platforms should be easily possible.

## Site

The game has its own page on [itch](https://phantasar-productions.itch.io/star-story-ii).
